# Bundle Update Log

## 2026-07-16

- **Capability registration (#649)**: added the `events-collect` capability to `catalog/capability-index.yaml` (Observability: Events; impl `alloy` active + `otelcol` considered, `swap_class: consumer-change`) — the prerequisite index entry the planned `observability/alloy-singleton` component references. Re-verified the two concepts carrying `capability-index.yaml` in `sources:` (`glossary.md`, `architecture/capability-layer-model.md`): no present-tense claim is affected (neither enumerates the capability set), timestamps bumped for the source touch.

- **Self-maintenance**: added the knowledge-bundle maintenance directive to `AGENTS.md` (§ Knowledge-bundle maintenance) and its mechanical backstop `task okf:freshness` (advisory; a `sources:` change in a PR without a concept `timestamp:` bump is flagged), run by `okf-freshness.yml`. Adopted hand-written from the upstream `openknowledge` `docs` rule; blocking flip tracked in #541.
- **Freshness re-verification**: bumped `reference/sub-layers/secret-management.md` for #524 — added the `vault-config-operator` workload row and resolved the former `vault-config-operator-crds` orphan-half gap note.
- **Review reconciliation (#522)**: corrected the catalog-scale count to **62 components** across the bundle (`vault-config-operator` #524 landed after the initial census); fixed the `vault-config-operator` sync-wave 0→1 in `reference/sub-layers/secret-management.md` (needs `cert-manager` wave 0 Healthy first); refreshed the `storage-block` `democratic-csi`/`synology-csi` rows + Gaps note for the now-defined `block-storage-network` capability (#538/#539). Hardened `task okf:install` to checksum-gate the persisted/GHA-cache-restored binary (was version-string only).

- **Initialization**: created the `knowledge/` Open Knowledge Format v0.1 bundle as a curated orientation layer over the catalog's architecture, contracts, gates, and workflows.
- **Migration**: relocated the repo-local decision record `docs/decisions/0001` verbatim into `decisions/DR-0001`; the `docs/` tree was removed.
- **Spec**: stored a pinned upstream copy of the OKF v0.1 draft in `SPEC.md`.
- **Tooling**: the `openknowledge` CLI (pinned v0.4.0) validates the bundle via `task okf:validate`; a `list --json` link gate hard-fails on unresolved or bundle-escaping links (the CLI's own `validate` reports those as warnings only).
- **Primary-home expansion**: established the bundle as the primary documentation home ([DR-0002](decisions/DR-0002-knowledge-bundle-as-primary-doc-home.md)); added one [reference concept per sub-layer](reference/sub-layers/index.md) (12 sub-layers, 62 components). A catalog gap analysis (documentation, architecture/capability, gate/coverage) is tracked in issue #523.
